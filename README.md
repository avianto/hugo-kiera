## Demo

Live demo: https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-kiera/

## Installation

Change into Hugo directory then:

```console
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/funkydan2/hugo-kiera.git kiera
```

More detailed instruction at [Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/deployment-with-nanobox/#install-a-theme).

Using `git submodule` is recommended instead of `git clone` as per recommendation from [Netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/#use-hugo-themes-with-netlify).

```console
$ cd themes
$ git submodule add https://github.com/avianto/hugo-kiera.git kiera
```

## Configuration

For reference look inside folder `exampleSite` for content example and `config.toml`.

*Important*: don't delete or move `archetypes` folder from root unless it is necessary. Current Hugo priority lookup will look into this folder first before any other `archetypes` folder and could cause problem.

Recommended optional `config.toml`:

```toml
pygmentsCodeFences = true

disqusShortname = "" #Disqus shortname
googleAnalytics = "" #Google Analytics ID

[author]
    name = ""       #Author name
    github = ""     #Github username
    gitlab = ""     #Gitlab username
    linkedin = ""   #LinkedIn username
    facebook = ""   #Facebook username
    twitter = ""    #Twitter username
    instagram = ""  #Instagram username

[params]
    tagline = "the tagline for this website"
```

## Main Menu

Add regular non-posts related page (eq. About page) to main menu by adding these lines to the page front matter:

TOML:

```toml
menu = "main"
meta = "false"
```

YAML:

```yml
menu: "main"
meta: "false"
```

```meta``` refers to time, categories, tags and reading time which are not necessary for this kind of page.

For posts listing page, add `_index.md` file inside `content\posts` folder with these front matter:

TOML:

```toml
+++
title = "Posts"
menu = "main"
weight = "10"
+++
```

## Categories & Tags

Both can be used, also can use only one of them or neither.

## Images

Kiera supports adding image as `img` tag with standard Markdown:

`![Image Title](link/to/image)`

to wrap it with `figure` use:

`{{< figure src="/link/to/image" >}}`

The basic placement is 100% width within content and scaled accordingly in smaller screen. Recommended width for image is 600 pixels minimum.

Kiera supports different placement by adding:

* For `img`, use `![Image Title](link/to/image#placement)`
* For `figure`, use `{{< figure src="/link/to/image" class="placement" >}}`

There are 4 configured placements

* `#full` or `class="full"` for full width.
![](images/screenshots/full-image.png)
* `#mid` or `class="mid"` for middle:
![](images/screenshots/mid.png)
* `#float` or `class="float"` for float left:
![](images/screenshots/float-left.png)
* `#float-right` or `class="float-right"` for float right:
